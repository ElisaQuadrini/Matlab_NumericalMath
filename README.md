# Numerical Analysis (MAT/08) course

## Main topics 
This course covered fundamental and advanced topics in numerical methods, including:
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) arithmetic and error analysis  
- Direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems  
- Approximation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Numerical methods for nonlinear equations  
- Data approximation and interpolation techniques  
- Numerical integration formulas  
- Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations  
Practical sessions were carried out in **MATLAB**, applying the introduced algorithms to real computational problems. Here in this repository different scripts can be found about the different algorrithm implementation

### FEM4MI 

FEM4MI is a MATLAB educational code developed for the *Numerical Analysis* course in Mathematical Engineering.  It is not an official library, but a collection of scripts and functions that implement the Finite Element Method (FEM) in 1D. The code provides a simple framework for mesh generation, assembly of matrices and right-hand sides, application of boundary conditions, error analysis, and visualization, allowing students to practice and experiment with FEM algorithms in MATLAB. For more details on how the methods work, see the text file explanation in this repository.
