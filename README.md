# Numerical Analysis (MAT/08) course

This course, which I attended from January to June 2022 during my bachelor degree, covered fundamental and advanced topics in numerical methods, including:
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) arithmetic and error analysis  
- Direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems  
- Approximation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Numerical methods for nonlinear equations  
- Data approximation and interpolation techniques  
- Numerical integration formulas  
- Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations  
Practical sessions were carried out in **MATLAB**, applying the introduced algorithms to real computational problems. Here in this repository can
